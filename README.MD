# Base Typescript project

Usually it is pretty painful to start a typescript project, especially if you are used to work with establised frameworks like NestJs. But as long as you just need a PoC and ignore all the boilerplate and complexity a framework provides a base project like this can come in hand easily

## Installation

Perform npm ci with node version >= 16.x.x. Tbh, I tested it with v18.19.0, but I expect to work anyway

## Usage

There is a .vscode folder which can be used to start a debugger. Following that, you just need to add your code

## Contributing

Feel free to raise PRs or fork it and use it however you consider. Happy Coding!
